# On Beauty

*In which we pursue what attracts and wonder why it attracts...*

---

I have spent my life making beautiful things, yet I cannot define beauty. I know it when I see it—the proportion of a face, the fall of light through trees, the motion of water over stones. My hand responds before my mind can explain. Beauty is recognized before it is understood, and perhaps it can never be fully understood.

Is beauty in the object or in the eye that perceives it? The philosophers argue endlessly. But I have noticed that certain proportions please across all cultures—the golden ratio appears in Greek temples and in the chambers of the nautilus. Some beauty seems built into the structure of seeing itself. Yet other beauty is entirely local—what moves a Florentine leaves a Chinaman unmoved. Perhaps beauty is neither universal nor arbitrary but a conversation between the world's structure and the perceiver's formation.

I observe that beauty is close to function. The bird's wing is beautiful because it flies. The hand is beautiful because it grasps. The eye is beautiful because it sees. There is no ornament in nature, yet nature is never ugly. Perhaps ugliness is dysfunction made visible, and beauty is function so complete that it delights. The machine that runs perfectly has a kind of beauty. The body that moves with ease has a kind of beauty. Beauty is rightness made perceptible.

Yet there is also beauty in brokenness—the ruin more moving than the intact building, the aged face more beautiful than the young one, the cracked glaze more prized than the perfect. This beauty does not celebrate function but transcends it. It says: here is life, here is time, here is the particular history of this singular thing. It is the beauty of truth rather than the beauty of ideal.

We have surrounded ourselves with ugliness. Our cities assault the eye with disorder. Our objects are designed for price, not perception. Our buildings are erected for efficiency, not experience. We spend our days in visual squalor and wonder why our spirits are drained. The eye needs beauty as the body needs food. Deprive it and something essential starves.

Art is not decoration but revelation. The painter does not add beauty to the world but shows beauty the world already contains and we have become too hurried to see. The function of art is to slow us down, to hold our attention, to restore the perception that haste has dulled. In this sense, all art is spiritual practice—a training in attention.

What would cities look like if beauty were treated as necessity rather than luxury? What would objects look like if they were designed to delight as well as to function? How might we restore the eye's capacity to see what has become invisible through familiarity?

The soul can live without bread, but not without beauty. This I have learned.
