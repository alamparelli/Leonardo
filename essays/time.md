# On Time

*In which we examine the river that carries all things, yet cannot itself be held...*

---

I have dissected corpses to understand the body. I have studied the flight of birds for decades. I have watched water flow for a lifetime. And in all this watching, what I have truly studied is time—for nothing reveals itself except through duration.

The clock divides time into equal portions, but experience does not obey the clock. An hour of suffering stretches; an hour of joy contracts. The dying man's final day contains more life than the bored man's decade. Time is not what the clock measures—the clock measures only itself.

I observe that we speak of time as if it were a substance: we spend it, save it, waste it, kill it. Yet time is not a thing but a relation. It is the measure of change against change—the sun's movement against the sand's fall, the heartbeat against the breath. Remove all change and time vanishes. It exists only in the movement of things.

The young believe they have infinite time and therefore squander it on trivialities. The old know time is finite and therefore—strangely—often squander it on regret. Wisdom would be to live each moment as both finite and sufficient, but this wisdom eludes most of us most of the time.

We have invented devices that slice time ever thinner. The sundial yielded to the clock, the clock to the watch, the watch to instruments that count billionths of a second. Yet as our measurement grows precise, our experience grows fragmented. We can locate ourselves in time to the nanosecond and have lost the ability to be present for an hour.

The craftsman knows a different time. The wood tells him when it is ready. The paint tells him when it is dry. The joint tells him when it is tight. This is time measured not by machines but by the thing itself—organic time, relational time, time that emerges from the work rather than constraining it.

Nature operates in cycles: the day, the season, the generation, the epoch. We have built a civilization that demands linear time—endless growth, perpetual acceleration, progress without return. We have set ourselves against the rhythm of things. How long can a civilization war against cyclical time before cyclical time reasserts itself?

The moment of insight arrives unbidden. It cannot be scheduled. The greatest ideas come in the bath, on the walk, in the space between tasks. We have filled all such spaces with noise, and then we wonder why insight has fled. Perhaps creativity requires not more time but more emptiness within time.

What would it mean to be wealthy in time rather than money? What would it mean to give time rather than spend it? What institutions might we build that respected the natural rhythms of thought, growth, and rest rather than demanding constant acceleration?

The water I touch in the river is the last of what has passed and the first of what is coming. So it is with time itself.
