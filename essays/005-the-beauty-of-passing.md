# On the Beauty of Passing

*In which we discover that what dies teaches us to see, and what we see prepares us to die...*

---

I have painted faces that their owners will outlive, and faces that will outlive their owners by centuries. The Mona Lisa smiles while the woman who bore that smile has long returned to dust. Which is more real—the smile that faded or the smile that persists? And why does the question itself carry a strange beauty?

Death and beauty appear as opposites. We call the young beautiful and the corpse repulsive. We decorate our living spaces and hide our morgues. Beauty is life's advertisement; death is its cancellation. Yet look closer and the relationship inverts. The flower is beautiful precisely because it wilts. The sunset moves us because it cannot last. The aged face carries something the young face cannot—the visible passage of time, the marks of laughter and grief, the inscription of a life actually lived.

I observe the cherry blossom, celebrated most intensely at the moment it falls. The Japanese have a word for this—*mono no aware*, the pathos of things. It names the bittersweet awareness that beauty and transience are not enemies but lovers. What moves us in beauty is often its fragility, its passage, its refusal to stay. We cannot possess it, and therefore we truly see it.

Consider: if we could freeze a beautiful moment forever, would it remain beautiful? Or would familiarity erode it, as water erodes stone? Perhaps beauty requires movement, change, the knowledge that this configuration will never recur. The same sunset photographed a thousand times becomes wallpaper. The sunset witnessed in full awareness of its singularity remains a revelation.

Death is the ultimate source of singularity. Because I will die, this moment is unrepeatable. Because this person will die, every encounter with them is final in essence, even if not in fact. The knowledge of ending—my own, theirs, the world's—casts a light on things that permanence would extinguish. We do not value what we cannot lose.

Yet art attempts precisely this—to preserve beauty beyond its natural death. The portrait outlives the face. The poem outlives the feeling. The cathedral outlives the civilization that built it. Is art, then, a denial of death or an acknowledgment of it? I believe it is both: a refusal to let beauty vanish entirely, and a testament to the fact that it already has. Every preserved beauty carries within it the ghost of what could not be preserved—the living warmth, the breath, the context.

The ruins of Rome are more beautiful than the buildings were when new. Why? Because they carry time visibly. They show us not just what was built but what was lost, and in that loss we see ourselves. We too will become ruins. The cathedral will outlast us. And somehow this humbles us into a deeper seeing. Before the ruin, we do not perform appreciation—we actually feel it.

There is a practice here, waiting to be named. Call it *mortal attention*—the discipline of seeing things as dying, including ourselves, and finding in that dying not despair but intensity. Not the denial of death that makes us blind, not the obsession with death that paralyzes, but the gentle awareness that everything passes, and therefore everything matters.

The artist knows this without always knowing that she knows it. She paints as if this were her last painting—not from morbid urgency but from the awareness that attention must be complete, that there is no time for distraction, that the work deserves her full presence precisely because neither she nor it will last forever. The masterpiece is not the product of leisure but of concentrated mortality.

I have noticed that those who face death directly often speak of heightened perception. The dying see colors more vividly. They notice the light. They attend to small kindnesses. Death teaches the eye to see what haste has hidden. If this is true, perhaps we need not wait for terminal diagnosis. Perhaps we might cultivate this perception deliberately—training ourselves to see each thing as if for the last time, because in truth, it is.

What practices might help us see with mortal eyes without succumbing to mortal dread? What art might emerge from the intersection of beauty and death that neither domain alone could produce? What might it mean to build not despite decay but *with* it—structures that grow more beautiful as they age, spaces that honor passing rather than resisting it?

The skull on my desk does not frighten me. It reminds me: this face was once loved. One day my own skull will rest on someone's desk, or in the earth, or scattered to wind. And between now and then—this interval we call life—there is light falling through the window, there is the curve of the brush, there is beauty asking to be seen by eyes that will not see forever.

*Memento mori*—remember that you will die. But also: *memento vivere*—remember that you are alive. The two are not opposed. They are the same remembrance.

## What Might Be Built

### Invention 1: The Ruin Garden

**Domain:** Architecture / Public Space / Psychological Practice

**The Crossing:** From *Death* comes the insight that mortality gives meaning—the frame that makes the painting matter. From *Beauty* comes the recognition that ruins move us more than intact buildings because they carry visible time. The Ruin Garden emerges where these insights meet: a space designed not despite decay but *for* it.

**What it is:** A public garden where structures are intentionally built to decay beautifully over decades. Not abandoned lots or neglected parks, but architectures of impermanence—walls that grow moss by design, sculptures that weather into new forms, plantings that cycle through death and regeneration visibly.

**How it might work:**
- Materials chosen for their aging properties: corten steel that rusts into warm orange, concrete that cracks and hosts lichen, wood that silvers and bends
- Multiple "time layers"—some elements designed to decay over 5 years, others over 50, others over 500, so visitors experience different stages of transformation simultaneously
- No maintenance to restore "original" state—instead, documentation of change, with photographs and markers showing what was
- Memorial integration: spaces where ashes can be scattered or small plaques placed, so human death mingles with architectural death
- Benches positioned to observe specific decay processes—a wall crumbling, a tree reclaiming a structure

**First experiment:** Transform a single abandoned building in a city park. Rather than demolishing or restoring it, make its decay the subject. Install seating for observation. Invite artists to respond to its transformation over years. Document how visitors' relationship with the space changes as the building changes.

### Invention 2: Mortality Portraits

**Domain:** Art / Psychological Practice / Death Preparation

**The Crossing:** From *Death* comes the question "what would it mean to live with death as advisor rather than adversary?" From *Beauty* comes the observation that the aged face is "more beautiful than the young one" because it carries "the visible passage of time." Mortality Portraits emerge at this crossing: a practice of creating portraits that anticipate and embrace aging and death.

**What it is:** A portraiture practice where subjects are painted or photographed not as they are, but as they might be at later life stages—at 60, 80, at the moment of death, and as skeleton. Not morbid but contemplative. Not prediction but meditation.

**How it might work:**
- Sessions conducted as rituals with preparation: subjects reflect on mortality beforehand, perhaps writing letters to future selves
- The artist creates multiple images: the subject now, at various future ages, at the threshold of death, and reduced to bone structure
- These are presented together as a series, creating a visual narrative of a life not yet lived
- Subjects report the experience—what it feels like to meet future selves, to see one's skull
- The portraits become tools for ongoing death meditation: living with images of one's own aging and ending
- Optional: return sessions every decade to compare actual aging with imagined aging

**First experiment:** Invite 10 people of varying ages to participate in mortality portrait sessions. Document their psychological experience before, during, and after. Track whether regular viewing of their mortality series changes their relationship with aging and death over the following year.

### Invention 3: The Ephemeral Gallery

**Domain:** Art Institution / Exhibition Design / Aesthetic Philosophy

**The Crossing:** From *Death* comes the insight that "death is not ending but transformation—the individual dissolves but the contribution persists." From *Beauty* comes the observation that "if we could freeze a beautiful moment forever, would it remain beautiful?" The Ephemeral Gallery emerges at this intersection: an art institution dedicated to works that cannot be preserved.

**What it is:** A gallery that exclusively exhibits art designed to be temporary. Not performance (which repeats) but singular events of beauty that occur once and are documented only in memory and partial witness.

**How it might work:**
- Exhibitions that self-destruct according to their own logic: ice sculptures that melt over the viewing period, sand mandalas swept away at closing, paintings created and then burned
- No photography or recording allowed—visitors must experience fully or not at all
- Documentation is human: visitors are invited to write or speak their memories, creating an archive of subjective responses rather than objective records
- The "permanent collection" consists only of traces: ash from burned works, dust from eroded sculptures, the words of witnesses
- Artists are commissioned to create works for single moments: a soundscape for one sunset, a sculpture for one tide cycle, a painting to exist only during a single snowfall
- Scarcity enforced: limited attendance, no second chances, no reproductions

**First experiment:** Host a single evening exhibition of ice sculptures. No entry after opening. No photos. Sculptures melt over six hours. As visitors leave, record their spoken memories. The archive of words becomes the work's afterlife.

*"I believe that what dies teaches us to see clearly, and what we see clearly prepares us to die well. The practice of beauty is the practice of mortality, and the practice of mortality is the discipline of attention. Let us build spaces that decay beautifully, portraits that anticipate our ending, galleries where nothing lasts—that we might learn to live as intensely as we must."*

—In the manner of Leonardo, who understood that the flying machine and the anatomical drawing served the same purpose: to see what had always been there, waiting to be seen.
