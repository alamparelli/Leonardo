# On Society

*In which we ask how many become one, and whether the one serves or devours the many...*

---

I have served princes and republics, popes and merchants. I have designed fortifications to protect cities and weapons to destroy them. I have seen how power flows, how decisions are made, how the few command the many. And I have come to believe that we understand mechanics better than we understand ourselves gathered together.

A single human is comprehensible. I can trace the muscles, predict the reach, estimate the strength. But put humans together and new laws emerge—laws of crowd and mob, of hierarchy and revolt, of cooperation and betrayal. The group is not merely the sum of its members. Something additional appears, and something essential disappears.

I observe that all societies face the same problem: how to coordinate many wills toward common action. The solutions have been force, tradition, market, and consent. Force is efficient but unstable—the moment the sword sleeps, the rebellion wakes. Tradition is stable but rigid—it cannot adapt without breaking. Markets coordinate beautifully but recognize no value that cannot be priced. Consent is slow and fractious but when achieved, proves durable.

Power tends to concentrate as water tends to pool. The powerful gain tools to become more powerful; the weak lose tools to resist. This is gravity in human affairs. And yet concentration eventually breaks—the empire falls, the dynasty ends, the monopoly shatters. Perhaps this cycle is inevitable. Perhaps the task is not to prevent concentration but to ensure it does not become permanent.

We speak of "the people" as if they were a unified actor with a single will. But the people are many, conflicted, changeable. What speaks for the people often speaks only for some of the people—usually those already powerful enough to be heard. The voice of the voiceless remains voiceless until structures exist to carry it. Democracy is not merely voting; it is the architecture that allows all voices to enter the conversation.

I notice that we have built organizations that outlive their members. The guild persists though its craftsmen die. The church continues though its priests pass. The state endures though its rulers fall. These are strange creatures—immortal abstractions that use mortal bodies to maintain themselves. We serve them, believing we control them. But who serves whom?

The ideal city I have designed in my notebooks—with its rational streets, its flowing water, its separation of functions—remains unbuilt. Perhaps it should. The designed city, like the designed society, fails to account for the mess and vitality of actual human living. The best cities grew; they were not planned. Perhaps the best societies also grow, and our task is to tend rather than engineer.

What would governance look like that distributed power as diligently as it accumulated it? What institutions might preserve the wisdom of tradition while enabling the adaptations of change? How do we build structures that serve the living rather than feeding on them?
