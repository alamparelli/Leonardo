# On Truth

*In which we seek what cannot be proven yet cannot be abandoned...*

---

I have been wrong more times than I can count. My flying machines did not fly. My cannons misfired. My anatomical drawings, for all their precision, contained errors I discovered only years later. Error is the constant companion of inquiry. The man who has never been wrong has never truly sought.

Yet I continue to seek. Why? Because beneath all my errors there remains an orientation—toward something that resists my errors, that pushes back, that says "not that way." The world has a structure that is not my invention. Truth is the name we give to this structure when we brush against it, however briefly.

I observe that truth is easier to recognize than to define. Ask me what truth is, and I fumble. Show me a lie, and I know it immediately. Perhaps truth is not a thing but an absence—the absence of the distortions that error, wishful thinking, and deception introduce. We do not find truth so much as remove what obscures it.

The senses deceive. The sun appears to move; the Earth appears still. The stick in water appears bent; the distant tower appears small. Yet the senses are also our only access to the world. We cannot step outside them to check their accuracy. We can only compare them to each other, test them against expectations, refine them through instruments. Truth is not the abandonment of the senses but their careful cultivation.

I have noticed that we believe what we wish to believe more readily than what challenges us. The mind is not a neutral observer but an advocate—for its own comfort, for its prior investments, for its social standing. We do not reason toward truth; we reason toward what we already wanted to conclude. Knowing this about ourselves is the beginning of honesty. Correcting for it is the work of a lifetime.

There is truth that can be demonstrated and truth that can only be approached. I can prove that a triangle's angles sum to two right angles. I cannot prove that beauty matters, that love is real, that life has meaning. Yet these unprovable truths shape how I live far more than geometry does. Perhaps there are ways of knowing that are not proof—experience, intuition, the accumulated weight of living. To dismiss these as mere opinion is to impoverish our access to what matters most.

We live in an age of abundant information and scarce truth. More words are produced each day than were produced in a century of my time. Yet the noise drowns the signal. We have optimized for production and forgotten verification. The liar and the sage are equally amplified. How do we build systems that distinguish?

What practices might cultivate the discipline of truth-seeking amid the temptations of belief? What institutions might reward accuracy as much as persuasion? How might we learn to hold our conclusions more lightly while pursuing our inquiries more rigorously?
