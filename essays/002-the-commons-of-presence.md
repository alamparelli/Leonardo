# On the Commons of Presence

*In which we discover that loneliness is the tragedy of the relational commons...*

---

A fisherman on a lake has no reason to limit his catch—until there are a thousand fishermen on the same lake. Then the logic that served him becomes the logic that starves him. Each rational choice, aggregated, produces collective ruin. This we call the tragedy of the commons.

I begin to wonder if there is another commons being overfished: the waters of human presence itself.

We speak of the loneliness epidemic as if it were a disease that arrived from outside. But what if it is not an infection but a depletion? What if we have exceeded the carrying capacity of human connection, just as we exceed the carrying capacity of atmosphere and ocean?

Consider: the village once imposed community. Your business was everyone's business. Gossip was the price of being known. But in that constraint—the limit of who was available, the boundary of geography—something could grow deep. The same faces, day after day. The same voices. The friction of repeated encounter wore grooves into the soul. We belonged whether we wished to or not.

Now we have access to billions. Every person on Earth is theoretically reachable. We swim in an ocean of potential connections so vast that any particular one seems dispensable. Why invest in the difficult neighbor when a thousand easier strangers await? Why repair what can be replaced?

But here is the secret that the essay on limits whispered and the essay on connection echoed: limits liberate. The sonnet's fourteen lines do not imprison the poet but demand depths that formless verse never requires. The river does not rage against its banks—the banks are what make it a river rather than a swamp.

What if human connection, too, has a carrying capacity? What if the mind can only hold so many faces in genuine presence before it begins to substitute symbols for persons? We have names for this: Dunbar's number, the anthropologist's observation that human groups stabilize around one hundred fifty members. Beyond this, we cease to know each other as souls and begin to process each other as functions.

We have built a world with ten thousand "friends" and no one to help us move our furniture. We have optimized for reach and eliminated depth. We have spread our attention across so many connections that each receives only a residue—a like, a comment, a momentary flicker of acknowledgment that vanishes as quickly as it arrives.

This is not connection. It is the memory of connection. It is the gesture without the substance.

The tragedy of the relational commons unfolds like this: each of us, seeking connection, adds another contact, accepts another follower, joins another network. Each addition seems costless. But attention is finite. Presence cannot be divided infinitely. Each new connection dilutes all existing ones by an infinitesimal amount. And a thousand infinitesimals become a catastrophe.

We have overfished the waters of presence. Our nets capture more and more while nourishing us less and less.

What would it mean to accept limits on connection? Not from inability but from wisdom? What would it look like to declare: *these one hundred fifty are my commons, and I will be a good steward of these waters*?

The village knew this without speaking it. Geography imposed what wisdom now must choose. The limit was given; now it must be taken.

I observe in nature that the richest ecosystems are often bounded: the coral reef, the forest edge, the estuary where salt water meets fresh. Boundaries create the conditions for complexity. Perhaps bounded communities create the conditions for belonging.

The question is not how to connect more but how to connect wisely. Not how to extend our reach but how to deepen our grasp. Not how to add but how to be present.

The river does not mourn its banks. The sonnet does not rage against its fourteen lines. And perhaps the soul need not lament the limits of its capacity for presence—for within those limits, something infinite can grow.

## What Might Be Built

### Invention 1: The Dunbar Garden

**Domain:** Social practice / psychological tool / digital-physical hybrid

**The Crossing:** From *Limits* comes the concept of carrying capacity and the liberation of constraints. From *Connection* comes the insight that connection is a practice requiring friction and presence. Neither essay alone suggests deliberately limiting one's relationships—but their intersection reveals that stewarding finite connections might produce infinite depth.

**What it is:** A deliberate practice of maintaining exactly 150 meaningful relationships, visualized as a garden with concentric rings. The innermost ring holds 5 (intimate companions), the next 15 (close friends), then 50 (extended community), then 80 (meaningful acquaintances). Each ring has different practices and rhythms appropriate to its depth.

**How it might work:**
- A physical journal or digital tool where one maps their relational garden
- Each relationship is a "plant" requiring specific attention rhythms (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally)
- Adding a new person to an inner ring requires consciously moving someone outward or letting them go—making the tradeoff visible
- Seasonal "pruning" rituals where one reflects on which connections are thriving and which have become hollow
- Visual dashboards showing the health of different rings based on actual contact patterns
- Prompts for depth practices: "You haven't had a meal with anyone in Ring 2 this month"

**First experiment:** Create paper templates for the Dunbar Garden and invite 20 volunteers to map their current connections, then consciously steward them for three months. Measure loneliness, connection satisfaction, and relational depth before and after. Document which practices emerge for maintaining different rings.

### Invention 2: Connection Commons Protocol

**Domain:** Social structure / governance / community design

**The Crossing:** *Limits* describes the tragedy of the commons at planetary scale—each rational actor depleting the shared resource. *Connection* describes the village's "web of mutual obligation" that ensured someone noticed if you didn't appear. The crossing reveals that presence itself is a commons requiring stewardship, not just individual practice but collective agreement.

**What it is:** A formal social contract for communities (neighborhoods, organizations, intentional groups) that treats collective presence as a shared resource. Members agree to limits on size, commitments to presence, and practices that prevent the relational commons from being depleted.

**How it might work:**
- Maximum community size encoded in charter (e.g., 150 members, with waiting lists)
- "Presence commitments"—minimum requirements for showing up (not just messaging)
- "Connection tax"—each new member requires endorsement from existing members who commit to integrating them
- "Absence protocols"—if someone hasn't been seen in X time, designated members reach out
- "Bandwidth limits"—restrictions on how many communities one person can be a full member of (preventing the tragedy of split attention)
- Collective practices: shared meals, working circles, celebration rhythms
- Explicit norms against substituting digital communication for presence

**First experiment:** Recruit one existing community (a cohousing group, a professional network, a church) to adopt a minimal version of the protocol for six months. Compare cohesion, mutual aid events, reported belonging, and loneliness to a similar community without the protocol. Document what practices are adopted, resisted, or adapted.

### Invention 3: The Depth Ledger

**Domain:** Cognitive tool / reflective practice / soft technology

**The Crossing:** *Limits* observes that we measure success by "more than last year" without asking "more than what end?" *Connection* observes that we have optimized for convenience and eliminated the friction that holds things together. The crossing suggests we need new metrics—ways of seeing relational depth that make the invisible visible.

**What it is:** A personal practice of tracking not how many connections one has but how deep they are. A "ledger" that records moments of genuine presence rather than mere contact, making visible the difference between communication and connection.

**How it might work:**
- Daily notation: not "who did I contact" but "who did I experience?"
- Criteria for presence: Did time disappear? Did I learn something new about them? Did I share something true? Was there comfortable silence?
- Monthly review: How many hours of genuine presence vs. hours of mere communication?
- Trend lines showing depth over time—is my relational life deepening or shallowing?
- Optional sharing: partners or close friends review each other's ledgers, noticing what the other might not see
- Warning signals: when breadth metrics rise and depth metrics fall, the ledger sounds an alarm

**First experiment:** Design a minimal paper ledger with clear presence criteria. Have 30 people keep the ledger for 60 days. Collect the ledgers, analyze patterns, and interview participants about what shifted in their awareness. Iterate the design based on what actually proved useful for seeing differently.
