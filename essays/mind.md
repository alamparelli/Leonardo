# On the Mind

*In which we turn thought upon itself and find it cannot see its own back...*

---

I have mapped the ventricles of the brain, traced the nerves that carry sensation, measured the skull that houses this strange organ. But the mind that does the mapping cannot map itself. The eye can see everything except itself seeing. This is the fundamental mystery: consciousness examining consciousness, thought thinking about thought.

What is a thought? I can describe the brain's grey matter. I can speculate about spirits and humors. But when I think, I do not experience matter or spirits—I experience meaning. The word "horse" conjures not neurons but the creature, its motion, its smell, its whinny. How does meat become meaning? This I cannot draw.

I observe that the mind is not singular but multiple. There is the mind that calculates, and the mind that dreams. The mind that plans, and the mind that panics. The mind that speaks, and the mind that watches the speaking. We say "I" as if there were one entity, but attention reveals a chorus, a parliament, sometimes a war. Which voice is truly "I"? Perhaps none. Perhaps all.

Learning fascinates me more than knowledge. Knowledge is what the mind contains; learning is what the mind becomes. A mind that learns deeply is transformed—not merely filled but restructured. The master and the novice do not have different information; they have different minds. The master sees what the novice cannot see because the master's mind has been shaped by decades of seeing.

Yet I observe how we educate: we pour information into minds as if minds were vessels. We measure what has been deposited and call this learning. But vessels are not changed by what they hold. True learning changes the learner. Perhaps we should measure not what students know but what students have become. And by this measure, our education often fails.

The mind freed from the body—this has been the dream of philosophers. Pure thought, uncontaminated by flesh. But I have learned that my best thinking happens with charcoal in hand, when the body is engaged, when thought must become mark. The mind alone spins in circles. The mind embodied makes discoveries.

We have built machines that calculate faster than any mind. They will soon calculate faster than all minds combined. But do they think? Do they understand? The question is not whether machines can process but whether processing is thinking. Perhaps we have mistaken the map for the territory, the simulation for the experience. Or perhaps we will discover that mind is simpler than we believed, and we have been machines all along.

What would education look like if it aimed to transform minds rather than fill them? What would wisdom look like if it honored the multiplicity within us? How might we cultivate the thinking that emerges from doing, not just the thinking that precedes it?
