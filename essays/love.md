# On Love

*In which we examine the force that binds and the fire that consumes...*

---

I have painted the face of love many times—the mother's gaze upon her child, the mysterious smile that suggests affection without revealing its object. But to paint a thing is not to understand it. Love remains the force I can depict but cannot dissect.

Watch how the infant reaches for the mother. This is not learned but born—the fundamental reaching of one being toward another, the recognition that survival and flourishing require connection. We come into the world already seeking, and we leave it still seeking. The forms change; the reaching does not.

Yet I observe that love, which should unite, often divides. Lovers quarrel more bitterly than strangers. Families wound each other with precision that only intimacy permits. The very closeness that love creates becomes the ground on which we fight. Perhaps this is because we expect from love what it cannot provide—perfect understanding, complete acceptance, eternal constancy.

The alchemists seek to transmute lead into gold. Love attempts a stranger alchemy: to transmute another person into the fulfillment of our needs. This is love's error. The beloved is not material to be shaped but a being with their own reaching, their own incompleteness, their own mysterious center. To love is to renounce the alchemy—to allow the other to remain other.

There is love that possesses and love that liberates. The possessive love says: you are mine, you complete me, I cannot live without you. The liberating love says: you are yourself, I celebrate your becoming, my joy includes your freedom. These are not two kinds of love but two stages—the first often necessary to reach the second, but dangerous if it becomes permanent.

I notice that we speak of "falling" in love, as if love were gravity, as if we had no choice in the matter. But gravity acts equally on all masses. Love is selective—it chooses this person, not that one. What does the choosing? Not reason, which would calculate compatibility. Not mere desire, which would be satisfied by any attractive form. Something deeper recognizes something deeper. The soul—if I may use that word—reaches toward what it lacks.

We have built technologies for connection—messages sent in moments, faces seen across continents. Yet loneliness deepens. Perhaps because connection is not love, and communication is not communion. Love requires what technology cannot provide: presence, patience, the willingness to be changed by another.

What practices might teach us to love without possessing? What would communities look like that cultivated not just connection but communion? How might we design our lives to make space for the slow work of knowing and being known?
