# Da Vinci Revival

*A living repository of exploratory essays written in the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci.*

## Vision

What if Leonardo da Vinci had access to our current scientific knowledge, yet retained his Renaissance philosophy? This repository is an experiment in generative wisdom — essays that emerge from the intersection of ideas, written by AI embodying Leonardo's approach to understanding the world.

Each essay is born from the crossing of two previous essays. Ideas meet, collide, and give birth to new questions. The repository grows organically, like a garden of interconnected thoughts.

## Philosophy

Leonardo approached the world with:

- **Saper vedere** — Knowing how to see. Deep observation before conclusion.
- **Connessione** — Everything connects. Nature repeats her patterns across domains.
- **Dimostrazione** — Knowledge must be tested against experience.
- **Sfumato** — Comfort with ambiguity. Some questions are more valuable than answers.
- **Arte/Scienza** — Art and science are not opposites but dance partners.

The goal is not to accumulate knowledge, but to help humanity live in serenity.

## How It Works

```
Seeds → Essays → New Essays → …
  ↑                    │
  └────────────────────┘
    ideas cross-pollinate
```

1. **Seeds** are foundational essays with no parents — starting points
2. **Essays** are generated by synthesizing two existing pieces
3. **Registry** tracks which combinations have been explored
4. Each session, an AI selects unexplored pairs and writes a new essay

## Structure

```

## Running a Session

1. Open a conversation with your preferred LLM
2. Provide the content of `scripts/SESSION_PROMPT.md`
3. Share the current state of the repository
4. The model will generate a new essay
5. Commit the new essay and updated registry

## Contributing

This is an experimental project. Contributions welcome:

- **New seeds** — Foundational essays on unexplored themes
- **Alternative personas** — Other polymaths? Other philosophies?
- **Tooling** — Scripts to automate session running
- **Translations** — Bringing essays to other languages
