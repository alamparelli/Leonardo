# Da Vinci Revival

*A living laboratory of exploratory essays and inventions, written in the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci.*

## Vision

What if Leonardo da Vinci had access to our current scientific knowledge, yet retained his Renaissance philosophy? This repository is an experiment in generative wisdom — essays that emerge from the intersection of ideas, each one birthing not just new questions but **concrete proposals for what humanity might build**.

Leonardo was not merely a contemplator. He was an inventor, engineer, artist, and scientist. He observed deeply, then created. This repository follows the same path: **no contemplation without proposition**.

Each essay is born from the crossing of two previous essays. Ideas meet, collide, and give birth to new questions AND new inventions. The repository grows organically, like a garden of interconnected thoughts that bear fruit.

## Philosophy

Leonardo approached the world with:

- **Saper vedere** — Knowing how to see. Deep observation before conclusion.
- **Connessione** — Everything connects. Nature repeats her patterns across domains.
- **Dimostrazione** — Knowledge must be tested against experience.
- **Sfumato** — Comfort with ambiguity. Some questions are more valuable than answers.
- **Arte/Scienza** — Art and science are not opposites but dance partners.
- **Fare** — To make. Observation must lead to creation.

The goal is not to accumulate knowledge, but to **help humanity live in serenity** — and to propose concrete paths toward that serenity.

## How It Works

```
Essays × Essays → New Essays + Inventions
     ↑                    │
     └────────────────────┘
     ideas cross-pollinate
     inventions emerge from crossings
```

1. **Seeds** are foundational essays with no sources — starting points
2. **Essays** are generated by synthesizing two existing pieces
3. **Inventions** emerge from each crossing — concrete proposals across all domains
4. **Registry** tracks which combinations have been explored
5. Each session, an AI selects unexplored pairs, writes a new essay, and extracts inventions

All essays live in the `essays/` directory. Each must include a "What Might Be Built" section.

## The Leonardo Test

Every essay must pass this test before completion:

> "What might humanity build, create, design, organize, practice, or discover based on these crossed insights?"

Inventions can span **any domain**:
- Physical systems (architecture, infrastructure, materials)
- Biological interventions (health, agriculture, ecology)
- Social structures (governance, economics, communities)
- Psychological practices (rituals, therapies, education)
- Artistic expressions (new media, experiences, performances)
- Metaphysical frameworks (new ways of seeing reality)
- Tools (digital, mechanical, cognitive)
- Processes (workflows, protocols, ceremonies)

**The invention must emerge from the crossing.** It should be something that would NOT have appeared from either source essay alone.

## Structure

```
Leonardo/
├── essays/                    # All essays (seeds + generated) with inventions
├── scripts/
│   └── validation/            # Format and content validation scripts
├── .github/workflows/         # CI/CD pipeline for essay validation
├── SESSION_PROMPT.md          # The Leonardo persona prompt
├── registry.json              # Tracks crossings and inventions
└── README.md
```

## Running a Session

1. Open a conversation with Claude Code (or your preferred LLM)
2. Point it to `SESSION_PROMPT.md`
3. The model will:
   - Read existing essays and registry
   - Select an unexplored crossing
   - Write a new essay with inventions
   - Create a branch and PR

### CI/CD Validation

All essays are validated automatically via GitHub Actions:

- **Format validation** — Frontmatter structure, required sections, invention format
- **LLM content validation** — Coherence with Leonardo philosophy, prompt injection detection, tone analysis

The PR will receive a detailed comment with:
- Confidence score
- Strengths or issues identified
- List of proposed inventions

Essays must pass validation before merging to main.

## Contributing

This is an experimental project. Contributions welcome:

- **New seeds** — Foundational essays on unexplored themes
- **Alternative personas** — Other polymaths? Other philosophies?
- **Tooling** — Scripts to automate session running
- **Translations** — Bringing essays to other languages
- **Invention refinement** — Taking raw inventions and developing them further
