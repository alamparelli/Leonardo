# On Collective Intelligence

*In which we ask why many minds together so often produce less than one...*

---

A single bee knows nothing of the hive's wisdom. Yet the hive finds flowers, regulates temperature, defends against threats—intelligence emerging from the interaction of simple creatures following simple rules. Why do human collectives so rarely achieve this grace?

We have built systems for thinking together: markets, democracies, scientific communities, corporations. Each promised to aggregate individual knowledge into collective wisdom. Each has produced marvels. Each has also produced catastrophic failures that no individual member would have chosen.

The crowd that lynches is also a collective. The market that crashes, the democracy that elects tyrants, the organization that marches toward obvious disaster while each member privately knows better—these too are products of minds combined.

I observe that information flows upward in hierarchies but truth does not. Each layer filters, softens, adjusts what the layer above wishes to hear. By the time knowledge reaches those who decide, it has been transformed into comfortable falsehood. The organization "knows" what no one within it would claim to know.

We are more connected than any humans in history. We can share thoughts across the globe in moments. Yet our collective decisions grow worse as our individual knowledge grows. The network that could coordinate wisdom instead amplifies panic, outrage, and error.

The problem is not stupidity but structure. How information flows matters more than how much flows. A well-designed small group outthinks a poorly-designed multitude. The question is not how to connect more minds but how to connect them wisely.

What structures let truth survive its passage through groups? What incentives align individual interest with collective accuracy? How might we design institutions that grow wiser as they grow larger, rather than more foolish?

The bees solved this problem long ago. Their dance communicates truth because no bee benefits from lying. Perhaps our failure is not cognitive but moral—we have built systems where deception pays.
