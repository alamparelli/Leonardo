## Opening

You cannot jump from A to Z. But you can always step from A to B.

## Development

Stuart Kauffman introduced the concept of the "adjacent possible" to describe how biological systems evolve. At any moment, there is a set of new configurations that are one step away from the current state. These—and only these—are accessible. Evolution explores this adjacent space, and in doing so, expands it.

The same principle governs all creative work.

Leonardo could not have invented the airplane. The adjacent possible of 1500 did not include lightweight engines or aerodynamic theory. But he could explore what was adjacent: the flight of birds, the behavior of air currents, the mechanics of articulated wings. His flying machines were failures as aircraft. They were successes as explorations of the adjacent possible—pushing the boundary outward so that future explorers could step further.

This is how knowledge actually advances. Not by leaps of pure genius that skip steps, but by patient exploration of what is currently reachable. Each step reveals new adjacencies. The space of the possible expands.

The implication is humbling: we cannot see very far ahead. We cannot plan the revolution. We can only explore the edges of what we currently know and trust that the adjacent possible will open new territories.

## Synthesis

Innovation is not about imagining distant futures. It is about thoroughly exploring the edges of the present. The visionary's job is not to see what no one else can see, but to notice what is adjacent when others are looking elsewhere.

The adjacent possible is always larger than we think. We are surrounded by doors we haven't tried.

## Questions

- How do we identify the edges of our current adjacent possible?
- What causes us to overlook adjacent possibilities?
- When should we explore broadly versus deeply?
- How do we know when we've exhausted the current adjacent space?
