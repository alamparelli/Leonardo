## Opening

Before we can explain anything, we must first see it clearly.

## Development

Leonardo filled thousands of pages with observations before attempting to theorize. He drew the same shoulder joint dozens of times, from different angles, in different states of motion. Only after this patient looking did he begin to understand how it worked.

This is the opposite of modern practice, where we often begin with a theory and look for confirming evidence. We see what we expect to see. The scientist who believes she knows the answer notices only data that confirms it. The manager who has already decided notices only behaviors that support his view.

The discipline of pure observation—recording what is actually there rather than what should be there—is the foundation of genuine knowledge. It requires a particular kind of humility: the admission that we don't yet understand, that our categories might be wrong, that reality might be organized differently than we assume.

Leonardo's eye was ruthless. He drew what he saw, not what anatomical tradition told him should be there. When his observations contradicted Galen, he trusted his eyes. This seems obvious now. It was revolutionary then.

## Synthesis

Theory without observation is fantasy. Observation without theory is mere collection. But observation must come first, because premature theory blinds us to what we haven't yet learned to see.

The cure for bad thinking is not more thinking. It is better looking.

## Questions

- How do we cultivate the patience required for deep observation?
- What techniques help us see past our preconceptions?
- When does observation naturally give way to theorizing?
- Can we ever observe without any theoretical framework?
