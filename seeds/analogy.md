# On Analogy

*In which we see how the unfamiliar becomes familiar through resemblance...*

---

To understand the unfamiliar, we map it onto the familiar. This is not a weakness of thought but its deepest operation.

I constantly reasoned by analogy. I saw the branching of trees in the branching of rivers, blood vessels, and lightning. I saw the swirling of water in the swirling of hair. These weren't poetic flourishes—they were investigative tools. By noticing structural similarities, I could transfer understanding from one domain to another.

Analogy is how we bootstrap knowledge. When we encounter something new, we don't understand it from scratch. We ask: what is this *like*? The answer provides a scaffold. We understand electricity by analogy to water flow. We understand the atom by analogy to the solar system. We understand the mind by analogy to computers (and before that, to hydraulic systems, telephone switchboards, and steam engines).

These analogies are always imperfect. Electricity is not water; atoms are not solar systems; minds are not computers. But the imperfection is productive. We use the analogy to get started, then notice where it breaks down. The breakdowns reveal what is unique about the new domain. Understanding deepens precisely where the analogy fails.

The danger is forgetting that the analogy is a tool, not a truth. When we mistake the map for the territory, we stop noticing the territory's actual features.

Analogical thinking is the engine of cross-domain understanding. It lets us apply what we know in one area to what we're learning in another. The price of this power is vigilance: we must continually test our analogies against reality and update them when they fail.

The best thinkers hold their analogies lightly, ready to abandon them when better ones emerge.
