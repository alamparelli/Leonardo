# On Limits

*In which we confront the edges of a finite world...*

---

A river cannot flow uphill. A fire cannot burn without fuel. A body cannot grow forever. Nature is made of limits, and limits are not failures of nature but its very grammar.

Yet we have built an entire civilization on the fantasy of limitlessness. Endless growth. Infinite expansion. Eternal increase. We measure success by how much more than last year, never asking: more than what end?

I watch the forests I knew as a boy become fields, the fields become towns, the towns become cities. Each generation inherits a diminished world and calls it normal. The baseline shifts and the loss vanishes from memory. We cannot miss what we never knew.

The atmosphere is a commons. The oceans are a commons. The soil, the aquifers, the very stability of climate—all commons. And the tragedy of the commons plays out now at planetary scale: each actor rational, each decision defensible, the collective outcome catastrophic.

We are clever enough to detect the limits. We measure the carbon, count the species, calculate the carrying capacity. We know. And yet we continue, like a man who sees the cliff edge approaching and presses the accelerator because slowing down feels like failure.

The strange truth is that limits liberate. The sonnet's fourteen lines do not imprison the poet but challenge her to depths that formless verse never demands. Perhaps a finite world is not a prison but an invitation to a different kind of flourishing—intensive rather than extensive, deep rather than sprawling.

What would an economy look like that sought enough rather than more? What would success mean if it were measured in resilience rather than growth? What wisdom might emerge from accepting that we are part of nature rather than its masters?

The river does not rage against its banks. The fire does not mourn its fuel. Only we demand exemption from the laws that govern everything else.

*Composed in the spirit of Leonardo, seeking connections where others see boundaries.*
