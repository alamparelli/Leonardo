# On Attention

*In which we examine humanity's most precious resource, now under siege...*

---

The eye can only see what the mind attends to. I spent hours watching a single eddy in the Arno, and in that patience, the secrets of water revealed themselves. What reveals itself to those who watch nothing for more than seconds?

We have built machines of infinite distraction. Each device in every pocket contains more calls for attention than a medieval city held in a lifetime. Bells ring, lights flash, messages arrive—and the mind, that faithful servant, leaps to answer each summons like a dog trained to salivate.

The merchants of attention have learned what I knew about painting: the eye follows contrast, movement, novelty. They exploit these ancient reflexes not to illuminate but to capture. Every scroll, every click, every notification is engineered to steal another moment of presence.

Yet attention is not merely time. It is the substance from which understanding is woven. A problem contemplated for ten fragmented minutes yields nothing. The same problem held in sustained focus for one hour transforms into insight. Depth requires duration.

I watch the young with their glowing rectangles. Their eyes dart, their fingers swipe, their minds touch everything and grasp nothing. They are not stupid—they are scattered. Their intelligence is intact but their attention is shattered into a thousand glittering shards.

The solution cannot be mere abstinence. We do not solve problems by retreating from tools. The question is whether we can learn to master what currently masters us. Can we rebuild the capacity for sustained thought in an environment designed to fragment it?

Perhaps the answer lies in understanding attention not as a resource to be spent but as a muscle to be trained. The monks knew this. The craftsmen knew this. Every master of any art knows that the first mastery is the mastery of one's own focus.

What practices might restore our scattered minds? What environments might shelter sustained thought? What would a civilization look like that protected attention as fiercely as it now exploits it?
