# On Acceleration

*In which we question the cult of speed and ask where we are rushing to...*

---

I spent four years on a single painting. I dissected bodies for decades before I understood the shoulder. I watched water for a lifetime. What understanding comes to those who have optimized away all waiting?

The world accelerates. What took generations now takes decades. What took decades now takes years. We measure progress in speed: faster processors, quicker deliveries, shorter attention spans. But speed toward what destination?

A tree grows slowly because growth requires integration. Each ring must support the rings above it. A tree that grew at the speed we demand would be hollow, brittle, quick to fall. I wonder if civilizations have growth rings too, and if ours are dangerously thin.

We have created tools that amplify human capability a thousandfold. But wisdom does not scale with power. The same species that required millennia to master fire now wields forces that can end life on Earth, and we have had mere decades to develop the wisdom to handle them.

The gap between what we can do and what we understand grows wider each year. We are children playing with the weapons of gods. Our reach has exceeded our grasp, and our grasp has exceeded our comprehension.

Slowness is not inefficiency. It is the time required for understanding to catch up with ability. The pause before speaking, the reflection before acting, the decade spent learning before teaching—these are not wastes but necessities.

I observe that every wisdom tradition discovered independently the value of stillness. The monks, the sages, the masters of every craft—all knew that certain things cannot be rushed. Perhaps what we call progress is sometimes merely motion, and what we call efficiency is sometimes merely haste.

What would it mean to slow down deliberately? Not from inability but from wisdom? What might we understand if we gave ourselves time to understand it?
